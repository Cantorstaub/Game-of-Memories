# Game-of-Memories

Game of Memories is a Game of Life Simulation running inside the memory of an emulated Instructor 50 computer. It was co-created with Stefan Höltgen in the [Signallabor](https://www.musikundmedien.hu-berlin.de/de/medienwissenschaft/medientheorien/signallabor) at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 2014.

As the Instructor 50 computer has no screen or visual output for the user other than a 7-segment LED to show addresses and opcodes and 8 red LEDs in a line, there would be no option to make the Game of Memories visible  when run on the original hardware. The emulator of this machine, on the other hand, provided the possibility to peek into the memory of the emulated machine, rendering the proliferation off living cells of the Game of Life visible.

The game was written for the Winarcadia Emulator [http://amigan.1emu.net/releases/#amiarcadia](http://amigan.1emu.net/releases/#amiarcadia) (last accessed: 2025-08-23)
